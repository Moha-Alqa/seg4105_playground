# **Pitch: Shop-Centric Display for the Weed Delivery Website**

## **Problem**
Currently, our website displays all weed products on one page without distinction regarding their source. This makes it hard for customers to identify or purchase from specific trusted providers. Feedback shows that customers are more inclined to buy from providers they've had positive experiences with. They value consistent quality and want to know the product's source if it falls short of expectations.

## **Solution**
Introduce a shop-centric layout, taking inspiration from popular food delivery apps. The main page will now spotlight different provider shops, making them the top-level category instead of individual weed strains.

### *Key Components of the Solution:*

1. **Provider Shop Display**:
   - **Homepage** will show tiles/cards for different weed shops featuring:
     * Shop logo
     * Shop name
     * Brief description or tagline
     * Average rating (if available)

2. **Shop-specific Pages**:
   - Dedicated page for each shop, showcasing:
     * All weed strains offered with descriptions, prices, and images.
     * Shop history, mission, or other relevant information.
     * Customer reviews/ratings for that shop.

3. **Flexible Shop Management for Providers**:
   - Providers get a dashboard or interface to:
     * Modify their shop page.
     * Add or remove strains.
     * Respond to customer reviews (if such a system exists).

### *Benefits/Intended Outcomes*:

- **For Customers**:
  - Easier identification of products from trusted providers.
  - More consistent quality experiences.
  - Informed decisions when trying new providers.

- **For Providers**:
  - Enhanced brand visibility and promotion.
  - Direct control over their shop's representation and product listings.
  
- **For the Platform**:
  - Improved user experience potentially leading to increased user retention and sales.
  - Strengthened relationships with providers through better visibility.

### *Constraints/Risks*:

- **UI Overhaul**: Implementing this change may need a significant frontend redesign.
  
- **Provider Engagement**: Providers must be introduced and familiarized with this new system.
  
- **Performance Issues**: The need for performance optimization becomes pivotal with each shop having its page and a potential abundance of products.

## **Next Steps**

1. **Prototype Design**: Create a visual representation of the new main page and individual shop pages.
2. **Provider Feedback Loop**: Engage with some trusted providers for feedback on the new design and understand their needs for the shop management tool.
3. **Development & Testing**: Start the development phase with an emphasis on the core features before moving to provider management tools. Extensive testing, especially around user experience and performance, is paramount.
