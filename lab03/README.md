# **Pitch: Shop-Centric Display for the Weed Delivery Website**

## **Problem**
The current website design displays all products on a single page without any differentiation regarding their origin or provider. Feedback indicates that customers prefer to purchase from trusted providers based on prior experiences. Not differentiating between stores leads to ambiguity and may prevent customers from making informed decisions. A majority of customers prefer to purchase from specific providers due to previous satisfactory experiences or perceived quality. Providers are also seeking better visibility and a dedicated space for promotions.

## **Appetite**
We're looking to implement this feature within a 6-week cycle. The focus is to streamline the customer's shopping experience by prioritizing provider recognition.


## **Solution**
Introduce a shop-centric layout, taking inspiration from popular food delivery apps. The main page will now spotlight different provider shops, making them the top-level category instead of individual weed strains.

### *Key Components of the Solution:*

1. **Provider Shop Display**:
   - **Homepage** will show tiles/cards for different weed shops featuring:
     * Shop logo
     * Shop name
     * Brief description or tagline
     * Average rating (if available)

2. **Shop-specific Pages**:
   - Dedicated page for each shop, showcasing:
     * All weed strains offered with descriptions, prices, and images.
     * Shop history, mission, or other relevant information.
     * Customer reviews/ratings for that shop.

3. **Flexible Shop Management for Providers**:
   - Providers get a dashboard or interface to:
     * Modify their shop page.
     * Add or remove strains.
     * Respond to customer reviews (if such a system exists).

    
## **Rabbit Holes**:
Customization Features: Diving too deep into allowing providers to customize every aspect of their page can lead us astray. We need to set clear limits on customization options.

Rating System Complexity: We aim for a simple rating system based on user feedback. Avoiding over-complicating it with too many parameters is essential.


## **No Gos**:
Live Chat Feature: Though it might be an excellent tool for customer-provider interaction, implementing a live chat system is out of scope for this feature.

Integrated Marketing Tools: While providers might want marketing tools, our focus should remain on displaying products and providers. Any additional marketing tools or promotional features will not be part of this iteration.


## **Benefits/Intended Outcomes**:

- **For Customers**:
  - Easier identification of products from trusted providers.
  - More consistent quality experiences.
  - Informed decisions when trying new providers.

- **For Providers**:
  - Enhanced brand visibility and promotion.
  - Direct control over their shop's representation and product listings.
  
- **For the Platform**:
  - Improved user experience potentially leading to increased user retention and sales.
  - Strengthened relationships with providers through better visibility.


## **Constraints/Risks**:

- **UI Overhaul**: Implementing this change may need a significant frontend redesign.
  
- **Provider Engagement**: Providers must be introduced and familiarized with this new system.
  
- **Performance Issues**: The need for performance optimization becomes pivotal with each shop having its page and a potential abundance of products.


## **Next Steps**

1. **Prototype Design**: Create a visual representation of the new main page and individual shop pages.
2. **Provider Feedback Loop**: Engage with some trusted providers for feedback on the new design and understand their needs for the shop management tool.
3. **Development & Testing**: Start the development phase with an emphasis on the core features before moving to provider management tools. Extensive testing, especially around user experience and performance, is paramount.
