# Summary of Elvis's Pitch
The document outlines a proposal for integrating a live chat support feature into a cannabis delivery platform to address common customer inquiries swiftly. The goal is to create a simple, robust live chat system over a two-week period that enables direct communication between users and support staff. The proposed solution includes embedding a live chat widget on the platform, notifying support staff of incoming chats, utilizing predefined scripts for common queries, and allowing users to review chat histories. It also encourages user feedback through chat experience ratings. Potential challenges include the temptation to integrate AI-powered chatbots or over-customize the chat UI, and reliance on third-party services that may not meet data privacy standards. The proposal explicitly excludes features like video/voice chat, multi-agent chat, and archiving chat histories beyond 30 days to ensure a focused, user-friendly, and privacy-compliant chat support solution.

# Summary of Jusley's Pitch
The document outlines a proposal for a Point/Referral System and Milestones feature for the King Kush Cannabis Web Store to reward customer loyalty. The aim is to create an engaging shopping experience by allowing customers to earn points on purchases, referrals, and achieving milestones. The points can be redeemed for rewards like discounts or free samples. The referral system rewards both the referrer and referee with points, fostering a community around the store. Milestones are set to encourage interaction and reward continued patronage. The project is set for a six-week timeline, avoiding potential rabbit holes that could derail the focus, such as blockchain integration, extensive data analytics, overly complex gamification, unrelated feature integration, and excessive customization. Each of these aspects, while beneficial, could significantly extend development time, increase complexity, or misalign with the core project goals. Hence, they will not be pursued in the initial implementation to ensure a user-friendly system and adherence to the project deadline.

# Summary of Andre's Pitch
The document presents a proposal for a scheduled/recurring delivery feature on the King Kush Cannabis Web Store to enhance customer convenience. The problem lies in the inflexible delivery timing which either leaves packages vulnerable to theft or requires repeated manual orders for regular customers. The six-week project aims to implement a straightforward feature enabling customers to schedule deliveries at specific times or set up recurring deliveries for the same order. To keep the project focused, some related features like real-time tracking, notifications, and editing delivery times post-submission will not be included in this phase. Although live shipment tracking could be beneficial, it's deemed non-essential and is reserved for future consideration post the successful implementation of the main scheduling feature.
