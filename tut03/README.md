A pitch, as explained by Jason, is not a detailed document but a directional statement, outlining the idea or feature to be developed, the problem it aims to solve, and some feedback or evidence from customers. It is typically around 800 words and gives the team enough direction to start the actual work without being overly detailed or prescriptive.

David emphasizes that pitches counteract the extremes of either having overly detailed specs or vague one-liners, aiming to find a middle ground that provides structure and clarity without being overly restrictive. The Shape Up approach rejects traditional estimation methods in favor of budgeting time for projects, allowing for flexibility and adaptability during development.

Both Jason and David highlight the importance of who writes the pitches. While anyone can propose an idea, typically, designated people on a team or product area write formalized pitches that determine the next course of action. They also discuss the concept of framing, introduced by Ryan Singer, which involves defining a problem and its business value before proposing a solution in a pitch. The distinction between identifying a problem and designing a solution is crucial, as different people in a company might be involved in these two processes.

David further explains that while customers are excellent at identifying problems, they may not always propose the best solutions. Therefore, it is essential for software designers to spot patterns in customer feedback and design cohesive solutions that address underlying issues. Writing a successful pitch requires awareness and understanding of software development constraints and system internals to create a feasible and effective solution within the allotted time.

David talks about how, even in a six-week project, the actual direction of the development will start to diverge from the initial plan after a couple of weeks. This divergence is seen as a positive aspect, as it allows for the discovery of better solutions and adjustments to the project scope and direction. The ability of the team to adapt and make decisions is valued over strict adherence to a predefined plan.

Towards the end of the conversation, Jason and David explain the concepts of "rabbit holes" and "no-gos" in project development. Rabbit holes are tasks or features that might seem appealing initially but can consume a lot of time and resources without adding significant value. David gives the example of developing a time zone auto completer, where a simpler solution (like a dropdown list) can be more efficient and valuable compared to a more complex and time-consuming approach.

Both Jason and David reflect on the gratification derived from their process. They highlight that allowing the team to understand the problem, have the trust and power to devise solutions, and being an integral part of the creative process leads to more interesting and satisfying work. This is mirrored in their long-term satisfaction and commitment to the company.
