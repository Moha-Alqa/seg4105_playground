# Stand-up notes
During the virtual meeting on November 7th, the team conducted a stand-up session where each member discussed their progress and plans. Mohammad Alqahtani updated the team's to-do list and hill chart yesterday and plans to work on the project scope and grant website access to the team today, anticipating potential blockers as implementation proceeds. Andre Yik, who also worked on task assignments with Mohammad, is set to reorganize the project management folders in GitHub today despite being ill. Jusley's focus yesterday was on a visibility study, and today's agenda includes developing wireframes. Elvis dedicated his previous day to brainstorming scope visualization and is sketching out a scope map today, with illness mentioned as a current obstacle. Both Andre and Elvis cited health issues as their blockers.
